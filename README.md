## Inspiration
We face parking problems in our daily lives and it only gets worse with the growing population. Working people go out to their daily jobs every day leaving their parking spaces idle for a long time this empty parking space can be used wisely by renting it out temporarily to needy users and it can also help them earn incentives and help the community.

## What it does
Find parking spots in your community that are available near you. Our parking website will keep you up-to-date with areas and will save you time by booking a parking spot in advance. Also, rent your parking place when you are not there and earn some incentives.

## How we built it
1. We made a Flexible Website with minimal UI/UX
2. Used HTML5, JavaScript, Css3 used to create a fully responsive and user-friendly website where users can list and find parking spots
3. Also used Used NoSql database to store parking spaces and added open-source local data-set provided by mentors
5. We are using IR and Ultrasonic sensors to check if the parked car is safe or not any disparity will trigger alarms both on the landlord's as well as car owner's device

## Key Features
1. Rent your unused parking spots and match them with drivers.
2. Park at verified spaces controlled digitally using IR sensors.
3. Your parking spot is reserved for you and youâ€™ll no longer have to worry about parking tickets
4. Rent parking that you can afford and the location you need.
